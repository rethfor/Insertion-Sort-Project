Patika-dev Insertion Sort Example Solutions

# 1) Insertion Sort step-by-step

[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> [2,27,16,22,18,6] -> [2,6,16,22,18,27] -> [2,6,16,18,22,27]

# 2)  Big-O notation of algorithm

O(n^2)

# 3) Various time complexities according to different situations. 

Average case: Desired number being at the MIDDLE => O(n^2)
Worst case: Desired number being at the END => O(n^2)
Best case: Desired number being at the START => O(n)

# 4) After sort operation, what case corresponds to searching for 18
Ordered array is [2,6,16,18,22,27] and since 18 being in the middle, it is an average case.,

# 5) Write 4 steps for insertion sort operation of given array [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]

[2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6] -> [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6] -> [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6] -> [2,3,4,5,6,9,8,15,7]
